                            <h3>LION</h3>
    <p>Lions (Panthera leo) are large carnivorous mammals belonging to the family Felidae.</p>
     <p> Lions are known for their distinctive appearance, characterized by their golden-yellow fur, muscular build, and prominent mane in males. The color of their mane can range from blond to black and varies depending on factors such as age and genetics. Adult males can weigh between 330 to 550 pounds (150 to 250 kilograms), while females are generally smaller, weighing between 265 to 400 pounds (120 to 180 kilograms).</p>
   <p>Lions are native to sub-Saharan Africa and the Gir Forest in India. They inhabit various types of habitats, including savannahs, grasslands, scrublands, and woodlands. Lions are social animals and are often found in groups known as prides, consisting of related females, their offspring, and a few adult males. Lions are apex predators and primarily feed on large ungulates such as zebras, wildebeests, buffalo, and antelopes. They are opportunistic hunters and will also prey on smaller mammals, birds, and occasionally reptiles. Lionesses are the primary hunters within the pride, using coordinated tactics to ambush and overpower their prey.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the lions at pen E7, south of the northern frontier.</p>
