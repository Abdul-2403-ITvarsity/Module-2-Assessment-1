                            <h3>GORILLA</h3>
    <p> Gorillas belong to the family Hominidae, which includes humans, and are divided into two species: the Eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei) and the Western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). Each species is further subdivided into two subspecies: the Eastern gorilla consists of the Eastern lowland gorilla and the Mountain gorilla, while the Western gorilla consists of the Western lowland gorilla and the Cross River gorilla.</p>
     <p>Gorillas have robust bodies with broad chests and shoulders, covered in coarse black hair. Adult males, called silverbacks due to the silver-gray hair that develops on their backs with age, can weigh up to 400 pounds (180 kilograms) and stand around 5 to 6 feet tall (1.5 to 1.8 meters). Females are typically smaller, weighing around half as much as males.</p>
   <p>Gorillas are native to the dense forests and jungles of central Africa. They primarily inhabit montane, lowland, and swamp forests, where they forage for food and build nests for sleeping.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gorillas at pen E16, right next to the monkey trail.</p>
