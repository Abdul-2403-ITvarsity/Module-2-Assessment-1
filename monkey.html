                            <h3>MONKEY</h3>
    <p> Pygmy Marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea), also known as the Dwarf Monkey or Finger Monkey.</p>
     <p>Pygmy Marmosets are considered the smallest monkeys in the world, with adults typically weighing between 85 and 140 grams (3 to 5 ounces) and measuring around 12 to 15 centimeters (4.7 to 5.9 inches) in length, excluding their tail.
      Pygmy Marmosets have a distinctive appearance with a mixture of colors. They typically have greyish-brown fur on their backs, with lighter fur on their undersides. Their faces are adorned with white markings around the eyes and a white vertical stripe on the forehead. They also have long tails, which are used for balance as they move through the treetops.
     </p>
   <p>These monkeys are omnivores, meaning they eat a variety of foods. Their diet primarily consists of tree sap, gum, and resin, which they obtain by gnawing small holes in tree bark with their specialized teeth. They also consume insects, fruits, nectar, and small vertebrates.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the monkeys at pen E17, right next to the giraffes.</p>
