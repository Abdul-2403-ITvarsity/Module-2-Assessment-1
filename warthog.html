                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
     <p>Warthogs are medium-sized members of the pig family, known for their unique appearance.
      They have a stocky build with large heads, short necks, and relatively long legs.
      One of their most distinctive features is the pair of upward-curving tusks protruding from their lower jaws, which are used for defense and digging.</p>
     <p>Warthogs are primarily found in savannah grasslands, woodlands, and scrub habitats across sub-Saharan Africa.
      They are adaptable animals and can also be found in semi-desert areas, as long as there is access to water and suitable vegetation for feeding.</p>
    <p>Warthogs are diurnal animals, meaning they are most active during the day.
      They are social animals and typically live in groups called sounders, which consist of females and their young.
      Male warthogs may lead solitary lives or form temporary bachelor groups.
      Warthogs are known for their habit of kneeling on their front legs while foraging, which helps them reach low-growing vegetation and roots.Warthogs are omnivores with a diverse diet that includes grasses, roots, bulbs, fruits, and insects.
      They are skilled diggers and use their snouts and tusks to root in the ground for food, especially during the dry season when vegetation is scarce.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the warthogs at pen E20, right next to the elephant enclosure.</p>
