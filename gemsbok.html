                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
   <p>The Gemsbok, or Oryx gazella, is a striking and iconic antelope species native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly found in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, and parts of Angola.
      Gemsbok are known for their striking appearance, with long, straight horns that can reach up to 40 inches in length. These horns are slender and straight, sweeping back from the head and can be used for defense against predators. Their coat is a light grayish-brown color, with lighter underparts and a blackish stripe running from the chin to the upper forelegs. They have distinctive black and white facial markings.</p>
   <p>Gemsbok are one of the largest antelope species, with males (bulls) typically larger than females (cows). Adult males can weigh between 400 to 500 kilograms (880 to 1,100 pounds), while females are slightly smaller, weighing between 200 to 250 kilograms (440 to 550 pounds).</p>
   <p>Gemsbok inhabit arid and semi-arid environments, including deserts, scrublands, and grasslands. They are well adapted to hot and dry conditions and can survive for long periods without water, obtaining much of their moisture from the vegetation they consume.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen E2, right next to the main entrance.</p>
