                            <h3>TIGER</h3>
    <p>Tigers belong to the genus Panthera and species Panthera tigris. There are several subspecies of tigers, including the Bengal tiger, Siberian tiger, Sumatran tiger, Indochinese tiger, and Malayan tiger. Tigers are known for their striking orange fur with black stripes, which helps them camouflage in their natural habitat. They have a muscular build and powerful limbs, enabling them to be excellent hunters. Tigers have a distinct pattern of stripes on their fur, unique to each individual, much like human fingerprints.</p>
     <p>Tigers are primarily found in various habitats across Asia, including tropical forests, grasslands, and mangrove swamps. They require dense vegetation for hunting and sufficient water sources for drinking and bathing.</p>
   <p>Tigers are solitary animals, typically only coming together for mating purposes. They are apex predators and primarily hunt large ungulates such as deer, wild boar, and buffalo. Tigers are known for their stealth and agility, often stalking their prey before launching a swift and powerful attack.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the tigers at pen E1, west of the pizza shop.</p>
