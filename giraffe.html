                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
    <p>Giraffes are large mammals of the family Giraffa camelopardalis. Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, with adult males standing up to 18 feet tall and females slightly shorter.
      They have long necks that can reach lengths of up to 6 feet, which contain the same number of vertebrae as humans but are elongated.
      Their coat is typically yellowish-brown with irregular patches of darker spots. The pattern of spots is unique to each individual giraffe and serves as a form of camouflage in their habitat.
      Giraffes have long legs with a spotted pattern extending down to the hooves. Their long legs allow them to reach leaves high up in trees, which makes up the majority of their diet.</p>
     <p>Giraffes are native to the savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa.
      They prefer areas with plenty of acacia trees, which provide them with their primary food source, leaves.</p>
   <p>Giraffes are herbivores, primarily feeding on the leaves, buds, and shoots of trees and shrubs, especially acacia trees.
      Their long necks and prehensile tongues, which can measure up to 18 inches long, help them grasp and strip leaves from tall branches.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen E27, south of the ampitheatre .</p>
