                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
    <p> Phascolarctos cinereus. Koalas are small marsupials known for their fluffy gray fur, large rounded ears, and distinctive black noses. They have stout bodies and relatively short limbs, with strong claws adapted for climbing trees. Koalas typically have a body length ranging from 24 to 33 inches (60 to 85 cm) and weigh between 9 to 33 pounds (4 to 15 kg).</p>
     <p> Koalas are native to Australia and are found primarily in eucalyptus forests along the eastern and southeastern regions of the country. They are arboreal animals, spending most of their time in trees, particularly eucalyptus trees, which make up the majority of their diet.</p>
   <p>Eucalyptus leaves are the mainstay of a koala's diet. They are highly specialized to digest the tough, fibrous leaves of eucalyptus trees, which are toxic to many other animals. Koalas consume a variety of eucalyptus species, selecting leaves based on their nutritional content and water content.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the koala at pen E22, north of  the amphitheatre.</p>
