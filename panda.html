                            <h3>PANDA</h3>
    <p>Pandas are large mammals of the family Ailuropoda melanoleuca.  Giant pandas are native to the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. They inhabit dense bamboo forests at elevations between 5,000 and 10,000 feet (1,500 to 3,000 meters) above sea level.</p>
     <p>Description: Giant pandas are easily recognized by their distinctive black and white fur patterns. They have a large, rotund body with black fur patches around their eyes, ears, and limbs, while the rest of their body is covered in white fur. Adult pandas typically weigh between 200 to 300 pounds (90 to 135 kilograms) and stand about 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 centimeters) tall at the shoulder.</p>
   <p>Bamboo makes up the majority of a panda's diet, with some individuals consuming up to 40 pounds (18 kilograms) of bamboo shoots and leaves each day. Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas have a digestive system more similar to herbivores, and they have a specialized pseudo-thumb, formed by an extension of the wrist bone, which helps them grip and manipulate bamboo.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
